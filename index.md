This is a Level 0: Foundation level course in ICHEC's Education and Training sector.

This lesson, "Introduction to Linux" has been designed for a 2-3 hour session. The goals are to get users who have 
little to no experience of Linux to learn, practice and implement the most important concepts of using a command
line interface.

This course will take you through from ground zero to being well practiced at UNIX commands and be able to transition
to working on an HPC.

On completion of this course, you should be able to take our Level 2 course, Introduction to HPC.

This setup has been adapted from the Carpentries [lesson example](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/)
for use at ICHEC.
