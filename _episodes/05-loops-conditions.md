title: "Loops and Conditionals"
teaching: 10
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can I perform the same actions on many different files?"
objectives:
- "Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files."
- "Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop."
- "Explain the difference between a variable's name and its value."
- "Explain why spaces and some punctuation characters shouldn't be used in file names."
- "Demonstrate how to see what commands have recently been executed."
- "Re-run recently executed commands without retyping them."
keypoints:
- "A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list."
- "Every `for` loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on."
- "Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). `${name}` can also be used."
- "Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as '*' or '?' in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion."
- "Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping."
- "Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them."
- "Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to search through the previously entered commands."
- "Use `history` to display recent commands, and `![number]` to repeat a command by number."
